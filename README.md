DengAI

Dengue fever is one of the well renowned mosquito- borne diseases that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. The transmission of dengue can be related to climatic variables since it is spread by mosquitoes. Using the environmental data collected by various Government agencies we try to predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in two cities- San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. This study aims to design two time series based Nonlinear Regression Models (NLRM) and a data manipulation technique using dif- ferent parameters such as temperature, vegetation and rainfall data and incorporating time series, dimension reduction for better prediction of dengue outbreak. This study considers three different modelling techniques namely Interpolation, Gradient Boosting Regression and Random Forest Regression. Parameters were tuned and adjusted for optimal performance. Comparisons of results are made based on prediction accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE). The performance was analyzed and the result points out that the Gradient Boosting Regression performs significantly better than the other models and is therefore considered to be a better approach. Future improvements to result can be made by obtaining large amounts of meaningful data and implementing better models associated with time series predicting
